# Contributors wanted

Lamdu is an open-source project passionately developed by [Eyal Lotem](https://github.com/Peaker) and [Yair Chuchem](https://github.com/yairchu), part-time since late 2011. You may say we are dreamers, but we're not the only ones. We hope some day you'll join us and programming will be fun.

Help us realize the dream!

## How to contact us

* Our [gitter chat room](http://gitter.im/lamdu/lamdu) is a good place for general chat and introductions
* Our [subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/lamdu/) is a good place for in-depth discussions and questions,
  as well as following our progress reports
* You can also find us in [Twitter](https://twitter.com/lamduproject)

## Reporting bugs

If you find a bug - feel free to open an issue in GitHub!

Be sure to mention in what Lamdu version and which OS the bug was produced.
If possible, try to build Lamdu's latest sources and also check if the bug reproduces there.

## Pull Requests

We would love to accept code contributions!

If your change is substantial, it's best to coordinate with us via GitHub issues or chat before putting in a lot of work,
because perhaps we have relevant ideas or even some of the work may already exists in a branch.

### Natural Languages

Do you speak a natural language not currently supported by Lamdu? Do you want to contribute translations to your language?

Great! It's quite a simple process:

* Add a language file to the [languages folder](https://github.com/lamdu/lamdu/tree/master/data/languages)
  (use the existing languages as examples)
* If the fonts currently included in Lamdu don't support your language, find suitable fonts (with a compatible license),
  add them to [the fonts folder](https://github.com/lamdu/lamdu/tree/master/data/fonts),
  and set your language to use these fonts
* Add names in your language to stdlib tags in `lamdu/data/freshdb.json` (the tags are at the beginning of the file)
* Add names in your language to the [different themes](https://github.com/lamdu/lamdu/tree/master/data/themes)

## Documentation & Lamdu's Website

This is an area where we can really use some help!
Writing isn't necessarily our forte
and our contributions are mostly in coding as we're really eager to
produce new features and fix bugs when they arise!
