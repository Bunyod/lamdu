# When names clash

In textual programming languages, functions and variables are referred to by their names.
One cannot give two variables the same name in the same scope, as there would be no way for the compiler to know which variable is being referring to.

## Name overloading

Some langauges, like C++, do have some mechanisms for "overloading".
The compiler infers which of several functions with the same name to call
based on the "function signature" inferred at the call site.

## When names clash in Lamdu

In Lamdu the situation is different: The compiler always knows which variable is used, because in the stored AST, variables are referred to by unique identifiers, which aren't their user-readable displayed names.

But the compiler isn't the only one who needs to distinguish between variables,
the programmer looking at the code also needs to distinguish between them!
For this reason when the user gives two variables the same name, they get displayed with "disambiguation tags" added to their names.

Disambiguation tags are small red numbers at the end of a variable name that Lamdu generates so that the user can understand which variable is used where.

In a similar manner to "overloading", when it's clear from the use that the variables are different,
then no disambiguation tags are added.
This only happens with applied functions, when their parameter names are different.

# Auto-generated names in Lamdu

In Lamdu, program ASTs are edited, and one may create code without actually giving names to all variables. But variables would still need to be displayed, and when not named by the user they will get auto-generated names.

Auto-generated names are often fine for small lambdas like `x â†’ x+1`, and not having to name those variables is convenient.

Lamdu also makes sure that the auto-generated names will never clash with other names. So if the user renames a variable so that it has the same name as an auto-generated name had, the auto-generated name changes, so that there will not be a 
clash! To clarify that the auto-generated names are ephemeral and could change when the user renames other variables, they are drawn with an *italic* font where they are introduced.

For local variables, Lamdu gives names such as `x`, `y`, etc. And in case it infers that the variable is a function it will name it `f`, `g`, etc.

The auto-generated names for global variables and type/tag names are ugly verbose identifiers. This is because we really want to encourage giving names to those.

# When do names clash?

## Variable/function names

When two variables are given the same name, but they are in different scopes, there is no clash between them.
Hence, variable names clash when two variables which are accessible in a common scope have the same name.

A variable from an outer scope may clash with several inner scope variables that do not clash with each other. In this case too all of them get different disambiguation tags.

**Idea/suggestion**: Only when an inner scope variable shadows an outer one, add a disambiguation tag to it. The outer variable need not have a tag. The number in the tag counts the number of outer variables shadowed.
In a sense, this reverts to de-bruijn indexing for variables that don't have unique names.

### Clashes in hole results

For any names introduced inside hole results (in lambdas), they are auto-generated so as not to clash with anything.

When browsing global variables or Nominal types in hole results - that doesn't change the expression outside the hole, so currently there are no disambiguation tags for these. **TODO**: Think of a better solution for this?

## Type names and tags

Type (and tags) are not limited to a specific scope so when two types have the same name they always clash.

*(Note that there would be less name collisions for tags soon when we implement proper tag holes in Lamdu - i.e same tag will be used)*

# Implementation of Lamdu's naming process

The name auto-generation and disambiguation is done for the "LamduSugar" language (Lamdu's language with "syntax sugars"), and the relevant code for it is under `Lamdu.Sugar.Names`.

* `Lamdu.Name` defines the `Name` data type for the names specifying their disambiguation numbers and whether they are given by the user or are auto-generated. This type is used as the "name" type-parameter for the sugar's expression types under `Lamdu.Sugar.Types`.
* `Lamdu.Sugar.Names.Add` is given expressions with `UUID`s for names and does the naming process to output `Name`s for names.

To find which names clash with which, and auto-generating non-clashing names, `Add` needs to do three passes on the expression tree.

These passes "walk" on the tree and change its "name" type-parameter. Because the traversal of the tree is the same for all three passes, we created a type-class, `MonadNaming`, for the passes, so that common AST-traversal code could be used for all of them.

* `Lamdu.Sugar.Names.Walk` defines the `MonadNaming` class and the expressions traversals for it.

The `MonadNaming` class also defines three type families, `OldName`, `NewName`, and `TM` (**TODO**: better name?), so that the walking functions have types such as:

    toWorkArea ::
        MonadNaming m =>
        WorkArea (OldName m) (TM m) a ->
        m (WorkArea (NewName m) (TM m) a)

The three passes each convert an `OldName m` to a `NewName m` and are:

## Pass 0: Load names

`Pass0LoadNames` converts `UUID`s to `MStoredName` (where the "M" stands for maybe, as not all identifiers are given names by the user). It just loads the user-given names.
The monad used is a simple Transaction monad, used to read the names from the database.

## Pass 1: Propagate inner scopes upwards

`Pass1PropagateUp` converts the `MStoredName`s to the `StoredNames` structure which adds to it a `storedNamesWithin` field which describes the names in the inner scopes (which could be clashed with).
The monad used is a `Writer` because it flows upwards (from inner to outer scopes) all the stored names used within.

## Pass 2: Give final names

`Pass2MakeNames` converts `StoredNames` to the final `Name`.
The monad used is a `Reader` because it flows the naming decisions already made downwards.
