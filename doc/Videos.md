# Videos

## Previous videos/talks

* [2014 Future Programming Workshop](https://vimeo.com/97713439) (also in [alternate source](https://vimeo.com/97648370), for aggregrating view counts): At the time Lamdu was rough and didn't have evaluation. The video introduced the basic concept of Projectional editing and Lamdu's approach for type errors.
* 2018 - [Scaling the REPL Experience](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skhP6LcbRTs). This video focused on the live programming aspects of Lamdu and a talk version was presented at the [LIVE 2018](https://futureofcoding.org/notes/live/2018) workshop.

## What goals do we want to achieve with videos

* The best thing would be to get someone excited enough to join us and contribute to the project!
* Get feedback.
* As Lamdu is already somewhat useful, make people aware of it, so that they could use it. The ultimate goal of course is for Lamdu to be very useful :) This will also get us some user feedback on things that we need to improve.
* Improve's people's knowledge about Lamdu / show that the project is still doing steady progress. Otherwise, similar minded folks, who could had joined us, will keep starting new projects with similar goals instead of joining forces and tackling the hard problems together.
* Get motivation.
* Who knows - someone seeing this or using Lamdu after this might even get us grants (money) to develop Lamdu? Then maybe we could work on it a lot more rather than just on our own free time.

## Plans for future videos or talks

### Fixing static types

* Describe how someone switching from Java to Python feels liberated. His code is shorter and easier to write. Everything is polymorphic without using cumbersome generics syntax or declaring interfaces
* Describe how someone switching from Python to Java feels liberated. Instead of servers crashing in the middle of his night due to silly errors, the compiler helps him avoid large classes of errors
* A type-inference proponent claims you can you have your cake and eat it too. Haskell lets you enjoy types and static-checking without all the hassle of explicitly writing them everywhere.
* However type-inference introduces new problems: Challenging type errors result from inference propagating mistakes to distant parts of the code, with confusing results.

So is there a way to get all the benefits without the problems? Is there a way to get rid of type-inference's problems to combine the ergonomics of Python with the safety of Java? We believe so. TODO: resume
